                    <h2>A Memorable Time: Christmas</h2>
                    <p>A time of joy and celebration.</p>
                    <p>Christmas is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ, observed primarily on December 25 as a religious and cultural celebration among billions of people around the world.</p>
                    <p>Christmas Day is a public holiday in many of the world's nations.</p>

                    <h2>A Cold Season</h2>
                    <p>Winter is the coldest season of the year in polar climates and temperate climates, between autumn and spring.</p>
                    <p>Winter is caused by the axis of the Earth in that hemisphere being oriented away from the Sun.</p>
                    <p>The moment of winter solstice is when the sun's elevation with respect to the North or South Pole is at its most negative value (that is, the sun is at its farthest below the horizon as measured from the pole). The day on which this occurs has the shortest day and the longest night, with day length increasing and night length decreasing as the season progresses after the solstice. The earliest sunset and latest sunrise dates outside the polar regions differ from the date of the winter solstice, however, and these depend on latitude, due to the variation in the solar day throughout the year caused by the Earth's elliptical orbit.</p>

                    <h2>A Time of Giving</h2>
                    <p>It’s that time of the year when people’s attention is focused on the holiday ritual of gift-giving.</p>
                    <p>Shoppers are scurrying about looking for the right gift for the special people in their lives.</p>
                    <p>Gift exchange is a major part of celebrating the holidays.</p>
